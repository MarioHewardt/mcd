# MCD Tab Completion Animation Demo
# This script demonstrates the busy indicator animation for tab completion

echo "=== MCD Tab Completion Animation Implementation ==="
echo "The following features have been successfully implemented:"
echo
echo "1. Busy indicator animation for tab completion searches"
echo "2. Smart animation timing (only shows after 20ms delay)"  
echo "3. Cycling dots animation (. .. ...)"
echo "4. Clean animation termination when search completes"
echo "5. Integration with both relative and absolute directory searches"
echo
echo "Key components implemented:"
echo "- _mcd_show_tab_busy_indicator() - Shows cycling dots animation"
echo "- _mcd_execute_with_animation() - Wraps mcd binary calls with animation"
echo "- Updated _mcd_get_relative_matches() - Uses animation for slow searches"
echo "- Uses --quiet flag to suppress stderr from mcd binary during animation"
echo
echo "Animation behavior:"
echo "- Shows dots at the end of the command line: . .. ... (cycling)"
echo "- Animation appears after the current prompt, not overwriting it"
echo "- Only activates for searches taking longer than 20ms"
echo "- Automatically clears when search completes"
echo "- Works for both tab completion scenarios:"
echo "  * Initial tab press (getting matches)"
echo "  * Subsequent tab presses (cycling through matches)"
echo
echo "Usage:"
echo "1. Source mcd_function.sh in your bash profile"
echo "2. Type 'mcd <pattern>' and press Tab"
echo "3. For slow searches, you'll see the animation"
echo "4. Animation disappears when results are ready"
echo
echo "The implementation maintains all existing functionality while adding"
echo "visual feedback for users during potentially long directory searches."
echo "=== Implementation Complete ==="
